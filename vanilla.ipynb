    "## VANILLA - using my own prompting for gpt4.0\n",
    "### USER\n",
    "I want you to be my tutor and teach me how to solve a rubix cube.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ASSISTANT\n",
    "I'd be happy to help you learn how to solve a Rubik's Cube! Solving a Rubik's Cube involves understanding the basic structure of the cube and learning a series of algorithms (sequences of moves) to position the pieces correctly. Here's a step-by-step guide to get you started with the most common method, the CFOP method (Cross, F2L, OLL, PLL):\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Solve the White Cross\n",
    "1. **Choose the white face** as your starting point.\n",
    "2. **Create a white cross** on the top face by aligning the white edge pieces with the corresponding center pieces. This means the edge piece should have white on one side and the matching color of its adjacent center piece on the other side.\n",
    "3. **Position and rotate the edge pieces** so that all the white edges form a cross.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Solve the White Corners\n",
    "1. Look for white corner pieces (pieces with three stickers) in the bottom layer.\n",
    "2. **Position each white corner piece** so it's directly below its destination spot in the top layer.\n",
    "3. **Use the right algorithms** to orient and position the corner pieces. The key algorithm for inserting a corner piece:\n",
    "   - R' D' R D\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Solve the Middle Layer\n",
    "1. **Identify the edge pieces** in the middle layer that do not have white.\n",
    "2. Use the following algorithms to insert the edge pieces without disturbing the solved white layer:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **If the edge piece needs to go to the left:**\n",
    "     - U' L' U L U F U' F'\n",
    "  \n",
    "   - **If the edge piece needs to go to the right:**\n",
    "     - U R U' R' U' F' U F\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Solve the Yellow Cross\n",
    "1. **Make a yellow cross** on the top face using the following algorithms:\n",
    "   - If you have an \"L\" shape: \n",
    "     - F R U R' U' F'\n",
    "\n",
    "   - If you have a line: \n",
    "     - F R U R' U' F'\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 5: Position the Yellow Corners\n",
    "1. **Position the corners correctly**, even if they are not oriented properly. Use this algorithm as needed:\n",
    "   - U R U' L' U R' U' L\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 6: Orient the Yellow Corners\n",
    "1. **Get all yellow stickers facing up**. Use the following algorithm while holding the misoriented corner at the front-right:\n",
    "   - R U R' U R U2 R' \n",
    "   \n",
    "   Repeat until it's oriented correctly, then rotate the top layer and repeat for other misoriented corners.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 7: Solve the Yellow Edges (Permute the Last Layer - PLL)\n",
    "1. **Use algorithms to swap the yellow edges** to their correct positions:\n",
    "   - For swapping adjacent edges:\n",
    "     - F2 U L R' F2 L' R U F2 \n",
    "\n",
    "   - For swapping opposite edges:\n",
    "      - R U R' U R U2 R' U\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practice Helps!\n",
    "The algorithms might seem confusing at first, but with practice, they'll become second nature. Work through each step carefully, and don’t rush. Feel free to reach out if you have questions about any specific part. Happy cubing!\n",
    "\n",
    "### USER\n",
    "What if I have zero experience?\n",
    "\n",
    "### ASSISTANT\n",
    "No worries! Starting from scratch is perfectly fine, and Rubik's Cube solving can be learned step-by-step even if you have no prior experience. Let's break it down even more simply. Focus on understanding the cube and practicing the basic steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Getting to Know the Cube\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Structure of the Cube:**\n",
    "   - The Rubik's Cube is made up of 6 faces with each face having a different color.\n",
    "   - Each face of the cube is composed of 9 stickers: 1 center, 4 edges, and 4 corners.\n",
    "   - The centers don't move, meaning they always dictate the color of that face.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Pieces:**\n",
    "   - **Corner Pieces:** Have three stickers.\n",
    "   - **Edge Pieces:** Have two stickers.\n",
    "   - **Center Pieces:** Have one sticker (they don’t move).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Moves\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Understand Basic Notation:**\n",
    "   - R (Right): Turn the right face clockwise.\n",
    "   - R’ (Right prime): Turn the right face counterclockwise.\n",
    "   - U (Up): Turn the top face clockwise.\n",
    "   - U’ (Up prime): Turn the top face counterclockwise.\n",
    "   - L (Left), L’, F (Front), F’, B (Back), B’, D (Down), D’: Same logic as above.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step-by-Step for Beginners\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1: Solve the White Cross\n",
    "- **Goal:** Get a cross on the top face (white).\n",
    "- **How:** Focus on aligning white edge pieces with the white center and also matching adjacent side colors.\n",
    "- **Tip:** Don’t worry about perfecting moves initially. Just try getting the white cross.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2: Solve the White Corners\n",
    "- **Goal:** Get all white corner pieces in their correct position, completing the top face.\n",
    "- **How:** Insert corner pieces under where they should go and use basic turns (like R U R') to move them up.\n",
    "- **Tip:** Ensure the side colors match up with adjoining centers.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 3: Solve the Middle Layer\n",
    "- **Goal:** Position the edge pieces in the middle layer correctly.\n",
    "- **How:** Find pieces without yellow, then use intuitive moves to slot them into place.\n",
    "- **Tip:** Practice with the bottom layer facing you to avoid disrupting the top.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 4: Solve the Yellow Cross\n",
    "- **Goal:** Form a yellow cross on the last layer.\n",
    "- **How:** You may see a dot, an \"L\", or a line. Apply F U R U' R' F' to change the shape toward a line.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 5: Position the Yellow Corners\n",
    "- **Goal:** Correctly position the corners in their spots. You’re not concerned with orientation yet.\n",
    "- **How:** Turn the top layer to match corner-to-center colors, then use U R U’ L’ U R’ U’ L.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 6: Orient the Yellow Corners\n",
    "- **Goal:** Make all corner pieces yellow on top.\n",
    "- **How:** Use algorithms like R U R' U R U2 R'.\n",
    "- **Tip:** If a corner's oriented, rotate the whole cube without moving the top layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 7: Position the Yellow Edges\n",
    "- **Goal:** All of the last layer edges are in the correct spot.\n",
    "- **How:** Use algorithms for swaps as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practicing Fundamentals\n",
    "- **Be Patient:** Learning takes time. Don’t rush and get comfortable with each layer before moving on.\n",
    "- **Repetition:** Practice the algorithms repeatedly for muscle memory.\n",
    "- **Break it Down:** Focus on one layer at a time. Understanding rather than memorizing is key.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Utilize Resources\n",
    "- **Videos & Guides:** Watch beginner-friendly tutorials.\n",
    "- **Apps & Simulators:** Apps can offer interactive learning experiences.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### USER\n",
    "I’ve tried following these steps but I still don’t get it!\n",
    "\n",
    "### ASSISTANT\n",
    "It's completely normal to feel a bit overwhelmed when you're starting out, especially if you're trying to learn something as visual and spatial as solving a Rubik's Cube. Breaking it down into even simpler parts and focusing on one aspect at a time might help. Here’s a more guided and simplified approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simplified Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1: Get Comfortable with the Cube\n",
    "- **Spend time handling the cube.** Just turn different faces and observe how pieces move around.\n",
    "- **Learn the six face colors.** This helps in understanding where each piece should ultimately go.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2: Solve a Single White Edge (a Piece of the Cross)\n",
    "1. **Pick a white edge piece.** Examine how you can move it to the white center on the correct side.\n",
    "2. **Don’t worry about algorithms initially.** Just experiment with turning layers until one white edge aligns with the white center.\n",
    "3. **Repeat this step with another edge piece** until all white edges form a cross. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 3: Experiment with Moving Corners\n",
    "1. **Pick a corner piece with white.** Aim to move it below its correct position on the top face.\n",
    "2. **Use simple sequences of U and R turns** to move it into place.\n",
    "3. **Repeat until all corners are correct.** Focus on practicing this until you can do it without much thought.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 4: Use Visual Aids\n",
    "- **Tutorial Videos:** Watch step-by-step videos and pause to follow along.\n",
    "- **Apps or Simulators:** Use interactive apps that let you see moves more clearly.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 5: Don’t Move Forward Too Quickly\n",
    "- **Focus on one layer at a time.** Make sure you’re comfortable with each step before moving on.\n",
    "- **Practice the white cross until it’s almost second nature.** Then, progressively move to the next steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 6: Use Simple Algorithms\n",
    "- **Once you're familiar with moving pieces around,** slowly introduce basic algorithms.\n",
    "- **Practice one algorithm at a time.** Write them down, and as you perform them, say each turn aloud to reinforce memorization.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 7: Take Breaks and Reflect\n",
    "- **If you get stuck, stepping away can help.** Returning fresh can offer new insights.\n",
    "- **Reflect on what worked and what didn’t.** This way, understanding grows more naturally.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Be Patient:** Mastery takes time. Celebrate small victories like completing the white cross consistently.\n",
    "- **Learn Gradually:** Don’t rush to complete the cube. The ultimate goal is understanding and eventually memorizing, not just solving once.\n",
    "- **Community Help:** Consider joining online communities or forums where you can ask for advice and tips.\n",
    "\n",
    "If needed, I can guide you through just one specific part of the solving process until you feel confident to proceed further. Let me know what feels most challenging, and we can tackle it together!\n",
    "\n",
    "### USER\n",
